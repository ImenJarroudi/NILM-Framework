Purpose
=======

Framework to implement Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) based on event
detection. This framework implements algorithms and methods developped by 
Hart in [1]. 

The goal of NILM is to breakdown a total consumption of an household
into applliances consumptions (fridge, aircon, etc). To do so machine learning
techniques (mainly unsupervised learning) are used.

Algorithm Overview
==================

The algorithm is composed of different steps:
